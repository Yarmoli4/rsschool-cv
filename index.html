	<h3 class="stroke"> Summary </h3>
	<div class ="space">I am a happy owner of an analytical mind. I can see the essence of a phenomenon, to understand its cause - this is what I do best. Moreover, I very easily find a common language with most people. 
It is these qualities that are critically important for an IT specialist, because we live in a new, information society. In it, computers play one of the main roles in the success of any enterprise. 
That is why the profession I have chosen is in great demand in our time. So I decided to go to the course "JavaScript Development". 
At the end of the course I want to obtain a position in EPAM. Of course, the difficulty with learning can not be avoided, but any difficulty can be overcome by a reserve of will, which is also within me. </div>
